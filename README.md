# hello-world

Hello! This is Derek.
I'm a self-teaching data scientist wanna-be.
I was a postgrad student in HK and worked mostly on scientific computing with MATLAB.
Then I decided to turn to the tech industry.
That's how things happen.

This week I'll be updating my data visulaization works.
I've been using seaborn and plotly to present HK's economic data.
Employing interactive graphs drives new insights to these data.

Early this month, I completed courses on deep learning and convoluntional neural network. 
A big shout-out to Prof. Andrew Ng

Welcome any collabration to boost my experience :)
